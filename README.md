# SGM-X48 Bitwig

Bitwig General MIDI Sounds / Songwriter Toolkit based on the [SGM-X48 Soundfont by
David Shan](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1rCL1lU-Q5P8g55PbfPRNggRO-OedAeH9).

I use Bitwig without plugins and I need a songwriter's toolkit where I can get
passable sounds from most of the common instruments. Since everyone is using
VSTs, nobody has done the work to make it a reality. I decided to get started
when I came across SGM-X48, a soundfont by 90s sounds enthusiast David Shan.
He designed it to run on a Sound Blaster, so it is very small. This is a big
plus, as you can't get Bitwig to use relative paths in `.bwpresets`, and all the
sounds have to be embedded.

# Feedback and contribution

I love getting feedback. Bitwig can only import very basic versions of
soundfonts. I have to do a lot of manual work and I am not an expert for most of
the instruments. If you have tweaked a patch you can submit a variant. Just call
it:

- Name - Variant [tag].bwpreset

# License

None, I guess. SGM-X48 is probably as legal as any personal vintage synth
sampling project. Which means use at your own risk.
